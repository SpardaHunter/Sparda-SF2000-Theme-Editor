How it works:
- Select the resource folder with the "Input folder" button
- Select the destination folder with the "Select Destination" button to save the individual images or the entire edited theme.
- Press the "Save" button to convert all images to the destination folder for your SF2000.
- In the pop-up window you can view, change or download the individual image, with the "Previous" and "Next" buttons you can change the file.

Additional explanation:
The program automatically checks if the folder has Foldername.ini or FoldernamX.ini, depending on the file you have, it will load the necessary files to edit the SF2000 Theme.
